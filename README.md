# typescript-practice
This repo is just to have a fun time with TypeScript

# Why?
It is just for fun and I'd like to widen my knowledge

I mean.. isn't it fun to learn something new!?

# My Note
Organizing things I learned [here](https://chwonseok.notion.site/TypeScript-b1966a408e1a4103bc2874a0a6445af4)

Feel free to check the link, and also feel free to let me know what to correct!

The note is still being updated as I learn more
